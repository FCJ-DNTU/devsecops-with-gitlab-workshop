DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) is a method for testing application security in its running environment. DAST helps identify security vulnerabilities that may only be present when the application is operational, by interacting with the application as an attacker would.

Arachni is an open-source DAST tool for web application security testing. It scans web applications to detect security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other security issues. Detailed instructions on how to use Arachni for dynamic security analysis will be presented in this section.

### 2. Familiarizing Yourself with the GitLab Interface

First, you need to get familiar with the GitLab interface. If this is your first time using GitLab, it will prompt you to create a new project upon login. Here, we create a group named `ecommerce` with a project called `frontend`. We do not select the option to create a README file. If you prefer, you can use the import option (which will be discussed later).

After creating the project, this is the GitLab Dashboard view.

On the left side is the sidebar of the `frontend` project. It includes basic functions such as:

- **frontend**: This is the name of your project.
- **Learn GitLab**: Provides resources and tutorials to learn how to use GitLab.
- **Pinned**: Where you can pin important items for quick access.
- **Issues**: Displays a list of issues (tasks, bugs, feature requests) related to the project. **`0`** indicates that there are no open issues.
- **Merge Requests**: Shows a list of merge requests to merge code from other branches into the main branch.
- **Manage**: Tools and options for managing the project.
- **Plan**: Tools and options for planning the project, including tasks and milestones.
- **Code**: Where you can access and manage the project's source code.
